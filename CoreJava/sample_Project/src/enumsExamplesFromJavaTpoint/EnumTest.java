/* 
You should use enum types any time you need to represent a fixed set of constants. 
That includes natural enum types such as the planets in our solar system and 
data sets where you know all possible values at compile time, 
for example, the choices on a menu, command line flags, and so on.

Here is some code that shows you how to use the Day enum defined above:

 */
public class EnumTest {
    Day day;
    
    public EnumTest(Day day) {
        this.day = day;
    }
    
    public void tellItLikeItIs() {
        switch (day) {
            case MONDAY:
                System.out.println("Mondays are bad.");
                break;
                    
            case FRIDAY:
                System.out.println("Fridays are better.");
                break;
                         
            case SATURDAY: case SUNDAY:
                System.out.println("Weekends are best.");
                break;
                        
            default:
                System.out.println("Midweek days are so-so.");
                break;
        }
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        EnumTest firstDay = new EnumTest(Day.MONDAY);
        firstDay.tellItLikeItIs();
        EnumTest thirdDay = new EnumTest(Day.WEDNESDAY);
        thirdDay.tellItLikeItIs();
        EnumTest fifthDay = new EnumTest(Day.FRIDAY);
        fifthDay.tellItLikeItIs();
        EnumTest sixthDay = new EnumTest(Day.SATURDAY);
        sixthDay.tellItLikeItIs();
        EnumTest seventhDay = new EnumTest(Day.SUNDAY);
        seventhDay.tellItLikeItIs();
    }
}
